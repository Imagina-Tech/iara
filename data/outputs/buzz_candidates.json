Within the metals & mining space, industry peers BHP Group (BHP +2.63%) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO +2.35%) climbed 2.66% and 2.43%, respectively, as investors weigh commodity-price leverage and capital-spending plans across diversified miners.

        "Securing a trademark is a vital move for most companies. Some will not even announce a new product without having the trademark secure. But sadly, electric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) is not one of them. It turns out that Teslaâs attempt to trademark âRobotaxiâ was declined by the United States Patents and Trademark Office. New reports note something similar just happened to Cybercab as well. The news did nothing good for stock prices, and sent Tesla shares careening down over 4% in Tuesday afternoonâs trading.",

        "Recently, Vale SA (NYSE: VALE) has experienced a 14.01% rise in short interest as a percentage of its float since the previous update. Data from the exchange indicates that 76.48 million shares are currently sold short, representing 1.79% of the total shares available for public trading. At the current trading volume, it would take investors an average of 1.91 days to cover all short positions.",
        "Understanding the Significance of Short Interest",
        "Short interest refers to the total number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been repurchased or closed. Short selling involves selling borrowed shares with the expectation that the stock price will decline. If the price drops, traders can buy back the shares at a lower cost and profit from the difference. Conversely, if the price rises, losses can occur.",
        "Monitoring short interest is valuable because it provides insight into how investors feel about a stock. A higher short interest often suggests a more pessimistic outlook, while a decrease may indicate growing optimism among traders.",
        "Three-Month Trend: Vale SA Short Interest",
        "The chart above illustrates the upward trend in Vale SA's short interest over the past three months. While this increase does not guarantee a near-term decline in the stock price, it is a development that market participants should keep in mind.",

        "Comparing a company's short interest to that of similar firms is a common strategy used by analysts and investors to assess performance. Peers are typically companies with comparable industry focus, size, age, or financial structure. Peer groups can be identified through company filings or independent analysis.",
        "According to Benzinga Pro, the average short interest as a percentage of float among Vale SA's peers is 6.27%. This means Vale SA currently has a lower short interest than most comp..."

Although we’re likely to see more variants in the future, Qualcomm made two SKUs official at CES 2026. There’s the X2P-64-100, which is a 10-core variant, which Qualcomm claims offers 35% higher single-core performance and 17% higher multi-core performance in Geekbench 6 than the prior-gen, and the X2P-42-100, which comes with six cores. Both sport boost speeds up to 4GHz, along with the X2-45 Adreno GPU and an NPU capable of 80 TOPS.",

The two models still boost up to 4GHz, but Qualcomm went with a six-core variant for its lower-end X2 Plus SKU instead of the eight-core design we saw in the previous generation. Although Snapdragon hasn’t confirmed further variants yet, there’s a good chance we’ll see additional versions of these chips in the future.",

        "Is Nvidia a Good Stock to Buy in 2026?",
        "With a market value of about $4.59 trillion, Nvidia has firmly established itself as the leader in AI chips. The stock has gained 26% in 2025, reflecting strong demand for its GPUs, which power data centers, cloud platforms, and large AI models. Spending from hyperscalers and large enterprises continues to support that demand as companies expand AI capacity.",
        "At CES 2026, Nvidia outlined its next phase of growth, including the Rubin platform, which is aimed at more advanced AI workloads over time. While these products will roll out gradually, they reinforce Nvidiaâs long-term role at the center of AI infrastructure.",
        "That said, valuation remains the key concern. Nvidia shares trade well above historical levels, leaving little room for error. The stock currently trades at around 46 times earnings, compared with a semiconductor sector average in the mid-20s. That multiple is also higher than peers such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), which trade closer to the low-30s range.",
        "With expectations already high, future gains are likely to depend more on earnings growth and execution than on product announcements alone.",

        "Despite valuation concerns, Wall Street remains largely positive. Analysts continue to point to Nvidiaâs strong position in AI chips, strong margins, and long-term growth outlook, while acknowledging that the stock i...",

Recent news reinforced that tension: the stock delivered very large returns in 2025 on the back of accelerating AIP adoption, then quickly pulled back around 12% as investors balked at a rich valuation, rotated out of software, and absorbed fresh insider sale notices. None of this appears to change the core near term catalyst, which is the upcoming earnings report and any update to guidance after a year of strong revenue and margin expansion. What it does sharpen is the key risk: a lofty multiple, heavy expectations and visible insider selling now leave far less room for operational missteps or softer AI demand.",

        "And while one analyst downgrade does not necessarily mean a wave will follow as trading volumes pick up now that traders are back from their holiday break, I do think that investors may wish to get ready for increased turbulence as we enter a period of seasonal sluggishness. In many ways, the current climate feels eerily similar to that one Apple navigated at this time last year. And if more downgrades come flowing in, perhaps the first half of 2026 might be a bit of a doozy for the iPhone maker.",
        "It’s too easy to be negative on Apple at the start of 2026",
        "Undoubtedly, it’s all too easy to be negative on Apple in January, given we’re quite a long way from the next iPhone keynote and there are timelier Magnificent Seven stocks to pursue as we head into the chilliest part of winter. With no Santa Claus rally this year and a bit of sell-side negativity regarding Apple to ring in the new year, perhaps it’s time to be a buyer rather than a seller now that Apple shares have shed close to 7% from their December peak.",
        "Of course, the January slump could accelerate as investors look past the strong iPhone 17 sales to end 2025, the surprise potential from the holiday season, as well as the big Gemini-fuelled Siri overhaul that looms this Spring.",
        "Perhaps such positives are easy to overlook, given the rather lofty valuation (35.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E)) going into the year, the production cut on Apple Vision Pro, recent churn in upper management, and uncertainties as to whether CEO Tim Cook will retire this year. All considered, it certainly feels uneasy to put new money into shares of Apple to start off 2026, even if it’s mostly rumors that traders are g..."

So far, Microsoft has not confirmed the plan. This move would follow a difficult 2025. During that year, Microsoft cut more than 15,000 jobs across several rounds.

Although the popular tech analyst from Wedbush remains one of the biggest cheerleaders of the world's most valuable company, NVDA did not make it onto Ives' list of stocks to watch out for in 2026. Instead, one of the names that Ives is excited about more this year is Microsoft (MSFT).",
        "Why is the Wedbush analyst so excited about MSFT stock? Let's take a closer look.",
        "Why Is Ives So Bullish About Microsoft in 2026?",
        "Making the case for Microsoft in a recent investor note, Ives and his team of analysts stated that Wall Street is “underestimating the Azure growth story” and that “the AI-driven shift about to happen in Redmond heading into 2026 [makes] Microsoft one of our favorite large-cap tech names.\" Ives and his team continued, \"While AI use cases built markedly in [fiscal 2025], it's clear [fiscal 2026] for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"",
        "This optimism around Microsoft is not new. Indeed, Ives has been bullish about the company ever since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014. Basing his bullishness on cloud and enterprise, the analyst has called Microsoft one of the most under-sung cloud stories in tech.",
        "After the pandemic-induced selloff in the MSFT stock, Ives highlighted it as a “table pounder” on the back of the company's pricing power, pristine balance sheet and significant cloud backlog. More recently, since the emergence of AI in the picture, the analyst's case for investing in Microsoft has only got stronger. Reiterating that Microsoft was in the “early innings” of its AI growth story, Ives maintained an “Outperform” rating on MSFT in late December with a $625 price target, citing AI and cloud momentum led by Azure.",

        "For investors in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), 2025 proved to be a lackluster year. The stock only rose about 5%, trailing the S&P 500‘s 16% advance and also lagging most of its Magnificent 7 peers, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gained just 8%.",
        "This underperformance stemmed from concerns over Amazon’s heavy capital spending and slowing cash flow generation. Yet, beyond a simple reversal of fortunes, the strategic investments position it for strong gains in 2026 as these efforts begin to yield results.",
        "Heavy Spending Pressures Cash Flow",
        "Amazon’s free cash flow has faced ongoing declines amid aggressive investments. In the third quarter, trailing 12-month free cash flow dropped to $14.8 billion, down 69% from $47.7 billion a year earlier. This followed a slide from $18.2 billion in the second quarter, driven by a $50.9 billion year-over-year increase in property and equipment purchases. Cash capital expenditures reached $34.2 billion in Q3 alone, with $89.9 billion spent year-to-date.",
        "Amazon’s capex spending ebbs and flows over time, marked by periods when its pouring money into new investments followed by phases of contraction where it waits for (and often sees) a payoff. During the heavy spending periods — such as the early years when it was building out AWS — spending ramped up to drive innovation and market leadership. Investors have seen signs for the past year that indicate Amazon has entered a new cycle — it could be its biggest yet — as AI becomes central to its strategy.",
        "Although this has weighed heavily on Amazon’s performance, the trend may continue into the fourth quarter when it reports results later this month, as full-year cash capex is projected at $125 billion for 2025, a significant jump from prior levels. Management has indicated capex will rise even more in 2026 to support its expanding infrastructure needs.",

        "The angry retailers say that they didnât consent to have their products listed on Amazonâs sprawling new AI marketplace. The complaints relate to Amazonâs âShop Directâ site, which features items from other online retailersâ websites and a button labeled âBuy for Me.â Clicking that button leads to an AI agent purchasing products from the other websites on behalf of consumers.",
        "Amazon has marketed the service, which is in the testing phase, as a way for shoppers to âfind any product they want and need,â including items not available on its own website. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly relied on third-party merchants for its products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers.",
        "The Backlash Against Amazonâs AI Agent",
        "While Amazon is arguing that its AI agent is driving business and sales to other online retailers, many merchants object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to social media posts. Some retailers grumble that the program has resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock and unavailable for consumers to buy.",
        "More than 180 businesses have reportedly contacted Amazon to complain that their products were listed on the e-commerce site without their permission. Amazon has responded to the backlash by saying that its Shop Direct platform helps âbusinesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales.â",
